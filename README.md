# `mecab-wrapper`

`mecab-wrapper` is a Rust wrapper of [Mecab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/), in consideration of lifetime and immutability.

Although there are nice crates that also wrap Mecab already, they have faults in terms of lifetimes or immutability. Therefore I decided to develop this crate.

This crate is highly specialized to Mecab v0.996.

Now we are developing the crate, and I will publish it after completing documentation.
